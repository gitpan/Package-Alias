NAME
    Package::Alias - alias one namespace into another

SYNOPSIS
      use Package::Alias
        main => 'Foo::Bar',
        Package::Name::Simply::Too::Long::To::Use => 'Pkg';

DESCRIPTION
    This module aliases one package name to another. After running the
    SYNOPSIS code, @INC and @Foo::Bar::INC reference the same memory.
    $Package::Name::Simply::Too::Long::To::Use::var and $Pkg::var do as
    well.

    Chip Salzenberg says that it's not technically feasible to perform
    runtime namespace aliasing. At compile time, Perl grabs pointers to
    functions and global vars. Those pointers aren't updated if we alias the
    namespace at runtime. It may be possible to do this with some work with
    XS.

BUGS
    alias() should return success or failure but I don't know what to check.
    Help?
